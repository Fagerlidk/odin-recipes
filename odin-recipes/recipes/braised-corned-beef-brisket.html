            <li>
                1 tablespoon vegetable oil
            </li>
            <li>
                1 onion, sliced
            </li>
            <li>
                6 cloves garlic, sliced

                2 tablespoons water

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.
